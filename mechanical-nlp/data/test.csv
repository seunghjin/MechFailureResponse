Failure: the flat sensor damaged at the end of the conveyor caused pinstop stayed down and flats with eggs passed straight to the transfer table without being vaccinated. | Fault: CONVEYOR,se detecta un sensor de filler con la seal activa parpadeando en todo momento. se prob uno verificando que fuera el sensor y no el cable lo que estuviera daado.
Failure: transfer head would lower to pickup eggs and would stay there.  hmi displayed lift control alarm. | Fault: LIFT SYSTEM (HEAD),replaced transfer lift motor.
Failure: got the call during the start if the device for the transfer they said error is coming plc can not determine module order  | Fault: NETWORK/STARTUP ISSUE,"after the call
1. i did check the alarm on hmi which clearly indicated there is no communication after the sr. 
2. i asked for wago picture there no signal at output in wago of injection and transfer module. 
3. then i asked for complete cabinet picture as well i saw there was no signal on communication cable input of injection while output of sr had one.
4. then i asked him to get simple lan cable and connect on first place of network distributor net-1 in the place of the cable 230286 and disconnect 230286 from it. also other part of it to fifth place of network distributor of sr in place of cable 230289. 
5. after this start the device and it started working. after that replace the input communication cable  95040808 on injection "
Failure: tr call for plc cannot determine module order. | Fault: ELECTRICAL/PLC,during troubleshooting multiple halt codes arose  transfer module expected transfer remote io order fault stop button pressed fault.  escalated to css support and advised to start troubleshooting the transfer wago plc module.  started by replacing power cards.  replaced faulty 24v1 24v2 and 0v1 cards.  machine and wago plc booted up normal and in ready state.
Failure: fluids leak from coupling. cleaner male coupling broken. | Fault: CLEANING CART,i replaced with water male coupling iron piece spare part temporary until receiving ordered spare parts. 
"Failure: la pantalla queda congelada con unas letras blancas en parte superior como se observa en el video.
the screen freezes with white letters at the top as seen in the video. | Fault: HMI/SOFTWARE","para restablecer la pantalla se actualiza los bios al actualizar se restablece la pantalla se hace la prueba apagando el equipo y encendiendo y la pantalla tiene el mismo problema del inicio congelada con letras blacas en parte superior despuesta de esta prueba se procede a cambiar la bateria interna de cpu y actualizar nuevamente los bios con este cambio de bateria el problema queda resuelto.

to reset the screen the bios is updated. when updating the screen is reset. the test is performed by turning the computer off and on again and the screen has the same problem of starting frozen with white letters at the top. after this test the internal cpu battery is changed and the bios is updated again. with this battery change the problem is solved."
"Failure: sensor de tanque de desinfectante no detecta al lquido equipo se detiene.

disinfectant tank sensor does not detect liquid equipment stops. | Fault: SANITATION SYSTEM","se le indica al operador del equipo que revisar en la pantalla de entradas si haba seal y no se observa el seal apesar que los led del sensor esta encendidos con esta diagnstico se indica que cambien el sensor y problema resuelto

the equipment operator is told to check the input screen to see if there was a signal and no signal is observed even though the sensor leds are on. with this diagnosis it is indicated that the sensor be changed and the problem resolved."
Failure: customer called indicating they had used all spare tooling due to sanitation blowback.  13 tooling were repaired with new u-cups and punches. | Fault: INJECTION HEAD/TOOLING,replaced u-cups and punches on 13 tooling.
Failure: during transfer error shown on screen flats not incoming after every 5-6 trays even though there was no delay during the operation. | Fault: ELECTRICAL/PLC,"connected machine without injector and tried to run the machine with empty trays.
the error on screen changed showing preceding exit not detected.
connected machine without remover and tried to run the machine with empty trays. the error did not change.
check every sensor signal on screen by placing an object in front of every sensor. found there was no output for left side exist sensor of control unit. replaced the concerned sensor.  "
Failure: received call from hatchery sr head not lowering far enough for haylos to reach eggs. lead operator could not replicate issue in manual mode. | Fault: LIFT SYSTEM (HEAD),"1. asked to confirm proper operation of egg lift lift working well.
2. asked if home sensor appeared to be tight in position and working appeared to be working well.
3. on site i pressed the test button and saw the home sensor did not register the flag until it had almost past the sensor head home position now too high.
4. tried adjusting sensor position this time flag traveled past home sensor and overtravel sensor causing motor alarm when reaching physical limit.
5. replaced home and overtravel sensors issue resolved."
Failure: the motor lift was very noisy and starting to give motor lift alarm. | Fault: LIFT SYSTEM (HEAD),i changed the lift lotor
